# HealthCareDashboard

Ways to improve are the first and last thing to think about when working on a project. Even as I go through a process I am always tring to look at how things can be better. This mindset has allowed me to see ways things can be improved or to find that things are good as they are. With this in mind, here are some improvments to this project that could be used in the future:

  1) Include a page with a more detailed drill down (e.g.Remburment rate, insurance verification, return patients)
  2) A graphic detailing the number of clients within X amount of days until delinguent on payments - then broken down by department
  3) Build scorecards for preformance measures (First idea that comes to mind is for clients based on how early they check in, pay history over a specified time, denied claims)

Fictional Data used for use in a data analysis project in the health care sector. I created just under 1400 "patients" then referenced various data sets from Kaggle to build out information on their appointments and payments.  

I created this fictional data set from Hair Salon No shows, medical costs, and medical appointments. Worked with the data sets to create a scenario for the health care sector. This gave a situation as if the data needed was not readily on hand. The collection required looking at various data sources and deciding if those helpped answer possible questions. Consolidation and orginizing the data was very detailed oriented. This required verifing fomatting or data, understanding what each part of the data meant to the entire data set, merging data between the reports that represent simular data points. 

Cleaning data - This required removing empty spaces, formatting data, removing duplicates primary keys and validating authenticity of data.

Preparing data - This presented several challenges with getting time between date, time stamps. Resolved these issues by breaking the date/time up into separate entries to work with. Decided that breaking the date down by day/month/year would not be needed for a demonstration product. 

Analysis Data - I am leaning on the visuals to present the overall thought process and convene what areas are in need of work within this company. The data created is intended to show competence in the tools and process, not to give an accurate analysis of any entity.

Presentation - The first view created is made with he intent to show the most important data up front in an easy to digest manner. This high view approach is designed to convey the most inportant data in a single glance. From these first slides, it is easy to see the average wait times, time spent with patients, total payent amounts, and a timeline for the year.

The Second view give a more detailed breakdown of the demographics of patients and appointments. The emphasis is placed on the appointments and No Shows for each department. With each graph working in succession from low level to high level view. This paints a good story of each departmentâ€™s matrix. The overall no show rates show how much can be improved in this area. In a real setting, there would be too many departments for this design to work in a pie chart. A better technique would be to use KPIs and show the trend from the previous month/quarter.

The final slide goes into payments. This shows payments received overall, payments received with the target at payments that could have been received without no shows (No Shows do pay a $35 fee that is factored into payments made). A time line is shown for payments based on appointments. The totals show the amount made from the appointments that month. For each department the total amount and percentage are shown which can show any possible issues that could use a deep dive. This entire data set assumes every payment is current and has no delinquencies. Understanding that this will more than likely not be the case in a real scenario, I have the payments by department made in a manner that could allow it to show amount made and amount delinquent.

After posting this, more things came to mind to make this better. 
Here are the current improvments:
  1) Include a page with a more detailed drill down (e.g.Remburment rate, insurance verification, return patients)
  2) A graphic detailing the number of clients within X amount of days until delinguent on payments - then broken down by department
  3) Build scorecards for preformance measures (First idea that comes to mind is for clients based on how early they check in, pay history over a specified time, denied claims)
  4) Formatting edits (fonts, text size, layout need to be scrubbed and fixed to match from one page to the next)
  5) Once the improvments aove are made, a layout can be planned out. This will allow each page to flow in a simular manner to the page before. This will make it easier to focus on the data instead of looking for what is needed.
