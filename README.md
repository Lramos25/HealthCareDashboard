# HealthCareDashboard
Fictional Data used for use in a data analysis project in the health care sector.

Using a data set from Hair Salon No shows and a data set on medical costs. Worked with both data sets to create a scenario for the health care sector. 

Cleaning data - This required removing empty spaces, formatting data, removing duplicates primary keys and validating authenticity of data.

Preparing data - This presented several challenges with getting time between date, time stamps. Resolved these issues by breaking the date/time up into separate entries to work with. Decided that breaking the date down by day/month/year would not be needed for a demonstration product. 

Analysis Data - I am leaning on the visuals to present the overall thought process and convene what areas are in need of work within this company. The data created is intended to show competence in the tools and process, not to give an accurate analysis of any entity.

Presentation - The first view created is made with he intent to show the most important data up front in an easy to digest manner. This high view approach is designed to convey the most inportant data in a single glance. From these first slides, it is easy to see the average wait times, time spent with patients, total payent amounts, and a timeline for the year.

The Second view give a more detailed breakdown of the demographics of patients and appointments. The emphasis is placed on the appointments and No Shows for each department. With each graph working in succession from low level to high level view. This paints a good story of each departmentâ€™s matrix. The overall no show rates show how much can be improved in this area.



The final slide goes into payments. This shows payments received overall, payments received with the target at payments that could have been received without no shows (No Shows do pay a $35 fee that is factored into payments made). A time line is shown for payments based on appointments. The totals show the amount made from the appointments that month. For each department the total amount and percentage are shown which can show any possible issues that could use a deep dive. This entire data set assumes every payment is current and has no delinquencies. Understanding that this will more than likely not be the case in a real scenario, I have the payments by department made in a manner that could allow it to show amount made and amount delinquent.
